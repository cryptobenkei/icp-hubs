    // 4. Pricing is determined by the applicable season

    Expected behavior:
    
    1. Admin creates a season for 1-2 letter domains:
       - min_letters: 1
       - max_letters: 2
       - total_allowed: 10
       - price_icp: 100
    
    2. Admin creates a season for 3-5 letter domains:
       - min_letters: 3
       - max_letters: 5
       - total_allowed: 100
       - price_icp: 20
    
    3. Admin creates another season for 3-5 letter domains (cheaper):
       - min_letters: 3
       - max_letters: 5
       - total_allowed: 50
       - price_icp: 15
    
    4. User tries to register "test" (4 letters):
       - System finds the cheaper season (15 ICP)
       - Registration succeeds if season has capacity
       - Season's registered_count increments
    
    5. Once a season reaches capacity:
       - New registrations fall back to other applicable seasons
       - If no seasons available, registration fails
    
    6. Season stats can be queried:
       - season_number: unique ID
       - names_available: total capacity
       - names_taken: current registrations
       - price_icp: price per domain
